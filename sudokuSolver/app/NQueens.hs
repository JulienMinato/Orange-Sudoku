--The n-queens problem looks for a way to put n queens on a n Ã— n chess board such that no queen is threatening another. 

-- The CSP variables are the columns, the values are the rows, 
-- and each assignment represents the placement of a single queen; 
-- the oracle function replies True on a pair of queen positions provided that the queens are on different rows 
-- and on different diagonals.

  where safe (col1 := row1) (col2 := row2) = (row1 /= row2) && abs (col1 - col2) /= abs (row1 - row2)
